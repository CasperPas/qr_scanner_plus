# For information on the generic Dart part of this file, see the

# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:
    # To add assets to your plugin package, add an assets section, like this:
    assets:
        - assets/images/
        - assets/ml/
    # For details regarding assets in packages, see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
    #
    # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
    # To add custom fonts to your plugin package, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
    # fonts:
    #   - family: Schyler
    #     fonts:
    #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
    #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
    #         style: italic
    #   - family: Trajan Pro
    #     fonts:
    #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
    #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
    #         weight: 700
    #
    # For details regarding fonts in packages, see
    # https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
